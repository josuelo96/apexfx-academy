  <section>
    <h3>What is the Forex Market?</h3>
    <p>The foreign exchange market â€” commonly called Forex or FX â€” is a global, decentralized financial market where currencies are exchanged. It is the largest financial market in the world, with a daily volume exceeding $6.6 trillion. This market is highly liquid, meaning trades can be executed quickly with minimal price differences.</p>
    <p><strong>Decentralized</strong> means that there's no single exchange. Instead, forex trading is conducted electronically between institutions, banks, brokers, and individuals.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>How the Forex Market Operates</h3>
    <p>The market runs 24 hours a day, 5 days a week, due to overlapping global trading sessions in Sydney, Tokyo, London, and New York. The most active period is when London and New York sessions overlap.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> Availability of buyers/sellers at every price level.</li>
      <li><strong>Volatility:</strong> Speed and size of price changes over time.</li>
    </ul>

  <section>
    <h3>Who Trades Forex?</h3>
    <p>Participants include central banks, commercial banks, hedge funds, corporations, and individual traders. Each has unique reasons, from speculation to business operations and risk management.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Speculation:</strong> Predicting price movement to profit.</li>
      <li><strong>Hedging:</strong> Protecting existing investments from currency risk.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Understanding Currency Pairs</h3>
    <p>Forex pairs are shown like EUR/USD = 1.1050. This means one Euro equals 1.1050 US Dollars.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Base Currency:</strong> The first currency in the pair (EUR).</li>
      <li><strong>Quote Currency:</strong> The second currency (USD).</li>
      <li><strong>Exchange Rate:</strong> How much of the quote currency is needed to buy one unit of the base currency.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Example:</em> Buying EUR/USD at 1.1000 and closing at 1.1100 yields a 100 pip profit.</p>

    <h3>Types of Currency Pairs</h3>
    <p>There are three main categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Major Pairs:</strong> Include USD and are highly liquid (e.g., EUR/USD).</li>
      <li><strong>Minor Pairs:</strong> Exclude USD but are still relatively liquid (e.g., EUR/GBP).</li>
      <li><strong>Exotic Pairs:</strong> Combine a major currency with a less traded one (e.g., USD/TRY).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Spread:</strong> The difference between bid and ask prices. <strong>Liquidity:</strong> More liquidity = smaller spreads.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>What Moves Currency Prices?</h3>
    <p>Currency prices react to economic indicators, political events, and overall market sentiment. For example, a higher interest rate in a country may attract investors, strengthening its currency.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Risk Appetite:</strong> Willingness of traders to pursue risky assets.</li>
      <li><strong>Safe-Haven Currency:</strong> Currencies like USD or JPY sought during uncertainty.</li>
    </ul>
